    this is a page for sabrina carpenter, since i don't really
    have a favorite artist or listen to music as much as i used to, my girlfriend 
    used to watch disney while i do my assignments, and i'm 
    not as into music as i was when i was a kid, so i'll do a 
    fan page for her.  Her music has a positive message
    for the modern world.  To me, her music is good because it 
    kind of sounds like car commercial music, the producers said they
    took influence from portugal the man, vampire weekend, etc etc
    and alot of those bands have a sound that is generically calming.
    I actually enjoy listening to her music when i code, because 
    its generally soothing, and i usually prefer something with guitars,
    because i used to play guitar for years, and drums on occasion.
