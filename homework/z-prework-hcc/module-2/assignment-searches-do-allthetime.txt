Since i can't transfer on my mobile...

or show my mobile as a PERFECT example of this 

here is what me and my dad were looking at the other day, 
i was showing him "HTTPS only" as it relates to session hijacking
see: my security oriented approach, and "the ZPI story"

Brave.com Jobs 

5+ years experience, 
i normally look at tech docs all the time, but it is mostly on my mobile 
because i do not keep tabs open on my windows system like i can with a phone.  

my dad had came to show me, because he knew i program in c++ when i was first getting started(simple stuff) 
requirements, continued: 
5+ years experience
has to know javascript performance details for browsers
v8 engine / chromium
basic html/css skills 

would typically look up, is brave powered by 
v8 javascript engine ? 

Because i can't use my phone with all the perfect examples, i'm sort of at a rush to do this ,
because i was HOPING for a module JUST LIKE THIS where i could show my searches on tech docs, 
based on a job i would like, and then going down the proper search "rabbit hole" to learning services, such as APIs


I was using google https://developers.google.com 
for looking at java docs for android the other day.  


1. Brave and V8. 
see above : 


i would then search for 
https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&ei=m7toW72zK43ysAW70pYg&q=what+javascript+engine+does+brave+use%3F+v8&oq=what+javascript+engine+does+brave+use%3F+v8&gs_l=psy-ab.3...108042.108656.0.109009.3.3.0.0.0.0.214.493.0j2j1.3.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.141...33i160k1.0.YUpUe6gZ5Cg


also raises the security question(but i know not to get too bogged down in that) 
of, parse this url................................................................... ^ what addr or hash? 

Since, at the moment, a question like that for me would be too broad, because i don't understand how the whole browser
works at a compiler like level, 
i would search 
https://developers.google.com/v8/
because i know v8 javascript engine is something that is used in most browsers, 
and that somehow node utilizes the same features, 

so i would compare that to the node.js docs 

and essentially view and compare v8 and node.js docs
also the specific w3 javascript, 
there are all sorts of places to compare and find information.  
https://docs.npmjs.com/

since node would be generally what i'm working on, or the level of study i am 
at right now, i would generally study these docs, 
there are also good javascript docs and for API (seperate concepts) 
at www.oracle.com  
oracle may be more JAVA oriented which is diffferent than JAVASCRIPT JS ES5/6 

AND FINALLY

the big thing stopping my progress on win10 

https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally

PACKAGES .   

although i hope git bash will change that, because i can do working with packages better on 
a tablet with TermUX than on a win10 machine.  (that says something) 




https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm


2.  The last one was a little informal and broad,  i hope i can show my mobile as an example .  
MyMobile.  

skip down for better part of assignment, my mobile will come later
Treehouse 



Module 11 reference: video from other source, 
in a video i was watching on instagram with "galvanized" bootcamp,
it seemed like the notification was timed with when i was recieving my pre work.

"BOOTCAMPS WILL TURN YOU INTO EXCELLENT GOOGLERS/SEARCHERS, IF THERES ONE THING A 
BOOTCAMP WILL MAKE YOU A 'ROCKSTAR' AT, YOU MIGHT NOT BE A 'ROCKSTAR CODER' BUT 
BOOTCAMPS WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO BE A ROCKSTAR AT SEARCHES"
SEE: BOOM! I NOW HAVE DOCS FOR BOTH THINGS THE JOB WANTS
REMINDER:  (DON'T SPREAD STUDYING TOO THIN FOCUS ON ONE THING AT ONCE)

HOWEVER, this shows an efficient way for getting docs for studying similar "skill chains" 

coming from more of an IT, military(esque type of perspective on security), i never was in, i just teach myself that kind of way from time to time, as well as have friends who HAVE done mil IT work. )) 

V 
Simpler Version: more close to the assignment, 
i get the feel for what they want, 
they're showing us how to look at tech docs.  

this is kind of how i wound up here, 
coming from a place where ive taken classes, 
but have been teaching myself, lately,  i am 
very very used to looking at these sometimes and then looking at 
docs as follows 



2.1 https://www.indeed.com/q-Simple-HTML-CSS-jobs.html
Apple 5,812 reviews
Santa Clara Valley, CA
5+ years of hands on front end development experience with web apps using HTML, CSS, Javascript and other industry standard frameworks....
Desired Experience: JavaScript, D3.js, HTML5, React, Front-End Development, Angular, REST, Unit Testing, AJAX, CSS, Ember


They want REST, AJAX and REACT
those are things that i am SOMEWHAT familiar with
BUT not complele confident in using them.  


good video tutorials for AJAX (asynchronus javascript and XML,
now usually AJAJ, asynchronous JS and JSON)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNKD0kfel6o

-----
and here are some docs for getting started with AJAX 


https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp

npm ajax docs
https://www.google.com/search?q=npm+ajax+docs&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-1-ab

BOOM, (trying to show that this is a "searching for tech docs, type process?" ) ; 

ive now just hit a result where they want EMBER and AJAX, 
NPM is giving docs for AJAX requests using ember,
it helps to do that to learn how the whole system works,
after you're done learning code, methods, different things, 
piece by piece.  

https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-ajax


Other videos i've watched: 
Stuff from fullstack.   it gives me great perspective for this bootcamp 
that i'm going into, some of the speakers might even be people the staff knows,
just gives me a closer feel.   Talks about MERN stack, some of the newer things 
in web going on etc etc, 
though i know OF alot of different things in web, i by no means know it all, which is why i'm here.
i think the above line statement rings true for programmers/devs in all of space and time :) ^ 

I have a TON of playlist archive URLS that i can show, 
if > see Personal&anonymity 


1. browser engine (broad) Brave: Senior Dev 5+ years, (situational example of life  the other day) 
also explained MyMobile has exactly these examples, but having to re create on a whim on desktop vs these prime examples i have on mobile coming from the "teach yourself" background,  but i don't want to make a bad first impression and want to do things the staff and the leaders way :) 


2-4 Front End Dev,(narrowed) Santa Clarita : http(s) indeed.com 
2.AJAX 3. REST(api) 4. Ember(framework)(scripting) 
4.9 special mention (npm) i think we will be looking at alot of NPM? (node package manager)

is npm node package manager?

i have a friend who is a legitamte artist, he shows in good galleries downtown etc etc.  
so he has shown me very cool things in the realm of graphic design, 

he even has his SEO rankings up wayyyy higher than normal for most people. 


2nd dream job, /realistic fallback / SEO, 
i love certain security type of things, and i love working with urls to see exactly what data is there. 
there is so much data passing in front of regular non tech peoples faces and they don't even know it, 
i was one of those people for so long until i was forced not to be.  

seo should've been included on here, but i've filled up all 10, 
assignment says not to put too much thought into it, 

and i have my mobile fully optimized because this is basically what i do anyway, 
but this desktop equivalent, even though having to start from scratch, is still a decent tech doc search, 
only nessescary thing would be to clean up the written word clutter i'm writing, 

but i'm also writing to maybe get some feel for instructors on a personal level, understanding where 
we all come from etc etc.
