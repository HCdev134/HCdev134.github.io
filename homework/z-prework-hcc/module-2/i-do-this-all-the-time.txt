can i show my mobile phone as an example? 
it LITERALLY has react docs that i was looking at.

i browse alot of docs on mobile, 
its one of the things that i need to work on, 
bridging the gap between browsing theory and coding along, 
but sometimes just the reading helps. 
 

i have 70 tabs of perfect examples, i just can't export all those 
urls to my email, so i am doing it a way that is less time consuming, 
though my mobile is surely a GREAT example that will be missed.
